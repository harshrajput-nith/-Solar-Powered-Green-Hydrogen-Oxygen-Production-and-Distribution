# ☀️ Solar-Powered Green Hydrogen & Oxygen Production and Distribution


This project presents a sustainable and eco-friendly system for the production and distribution of **green hydrogen and oxygen** using **solar energy**. The initiative aims to support clean energy transitions, reduce carbon emissions, and supply critical resources to rural or underserved areas near NIT Hamirpur.

---

## 🌍 Objective

To design and implement a solar-powered electrolysis system that generates **high-purity hydrogen and oxygen**, and distributes them efficiently for applications in energy, industry, and healthcare.

---

## ⚡ Abstract

This project utilizes **solar photovoltaic panels** to power the electrolysis of water, producing hydrogen (H₂) as a clean fuel and oxygen (O₂) as a valuable byproduct. The system incorporates:
- High-efficiency solar panels
- Advanced electrolysis units
- Storage tanks
- A distribution network to deliver hydrogen and oxygen to remote or needy locations

By relying entirely on renewable energy, the project promotes carbon-neutral fuel production while addressing energy scarcity in rural areas.

> 🌿 *Empowering sustainability through clean energy innovation.*
